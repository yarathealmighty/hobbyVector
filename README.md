# hobbyVector
This is a project that aims to make mathematically correct vectors and matrices in C++. It originally started as a hobby project and an exercise for dynamic memory allocation.

Important notes for dev(s):
- by yarr:
	- #define TESTING 			is used for new implementations and functions, can be left out if said function or implementation has been tested and is functioning correctly
	- #define DEBUG 				is used for looking into states of different values during runtime

Feel free to add custom #define switches if they make sense, but add them here too please with descriptions such as the previous ones.
If you have some implementations that are needed and don't think it's issueworthy, put them into todo.txt
